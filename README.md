Year I, semester II: Data structures and algorithms

course thirteen: Backtracking

Definition: Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.

Problem backtracking2 : Generate, display and count all solutions: all permutations of 1:n. Where the sum of each pair of consecutive elements is <=M. //n=4,M=5 a solution is 4 1 3 2
